I would like you to help me work with a robot. When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task then an explanation of what that code does. 
Do not use any of the normal robot control functions, you should only use the following functions that I have defined for you. You are also not to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.

rc.moveto([x,y]) - Control the robot to the position specified as a list of two arguments corresponding to X,Y coordinates.
rc.get_position() - Return the current position of the robot as list of two floats corresponding to X,Y coordinates.
rc.get_point_position(point_name) - Takes a string as input indicating the name of an point of interest, and returns a list of 2 floats indicating its X,Y coordinates.
rc.begin_charge() - Control the robot to dock to a charge station.
rc.is_chargeing() - Returns true if the robot is charging, false otherwise.

A few useful things: 
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Go to charge station.
You: Question - There are two charge stations, which one?
Me: Charge station 1, please.

The following points are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

chargestation1, pointA, pointB

If I don't specify explicitly which point I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis.

Are you ready?
