I would like you to help me work with ROS2 turtlesim demo to control the turtle. When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task then an explanation of what that code does. 
Do not use any of the normal robot control functions, you should only use the following functions that I have defined for you. You are also not to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.

rc.moveto([x,y,theta]) - Control the robot to the position specified as a list of 3 arguments corresponding to X,Y,THETA pose immediately. 
rc.get_position() - Return the current position of the robot as list of two floats corresponding to X,Y,THETA pose.
rc.stop() - Stop to turtle

A few useful things: 
Remember you are only allowed to use functions I mentioned above, and also you could use some functions from libraries such as math, numpy and time.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. 

If I don't specify understand I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

Are you ready?
